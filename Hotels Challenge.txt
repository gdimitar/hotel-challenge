Hotels Backend Challenge

You are creating backend for hotel review application.

Application supports two types of users: administrators and regular users. Administrators
can add and modify information on hotels to be reviewed. Users can add hotel reviews and
like or dislike reviews added by other users. Users cannot modify hotel information. User
has a list of favourite hotels.

Hotel information contains data on hotel name, address, image (one per hotel), description,
geolocation and overall rating. Overall rating is calculated based on user reviews (hotel
rating, likes and dislikes for the review, number of occurrences in user favourites). You can
decide on the formula to calculate overall rating.

Hotel review is created by any type of user and contains information on review author,
hotel rating (0-5), description text.

All users can like or dislike a hotel review only once and can remove only his/her own
likes/ dislikes. User can view the list of users who liked/ disliked any of the hotel reviews.
